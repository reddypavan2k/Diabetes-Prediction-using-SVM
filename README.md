Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Diabetes Prediction

-> Overview

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict diabetes based on medical diagnostic features. The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains various health-related attributes.

-> Dataset

The dataset consists of the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration (mg/dL)

Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/height in mÂ²)

Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history

Age: Age of the patient in years

Outcome: Target variable (1 for diabetic, 0 for non-diabetic)
