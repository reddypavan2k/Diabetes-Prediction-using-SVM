Overview

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict diabetes based on medical diagnostic features. The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains various health-related attributes.

Dataset

The dataset consists of the following features:

1.	Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
2.	Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration (mg/dL)
3.	Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4.	Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
5.	Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6.	BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/height in m)
7.	Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
8.	Age: Age of the patient in years
9.	Outcome: Target variable (1 for diabetic, 0 for non-diabetic)

How to Run the Colab File

1.	Open Google Colab (colab.research.google.com).
2.	Upload the notebook file (SVM_Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb) by clicking on File → Upload Notebook.
3.	Ensure that the dataset (diabetes.csv) is also uploaded to Colab. You can do this by clicking on the Files tab and uploading the dataset.
4.	Run each cell sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, train the SVM model, and evaluate its performance.
5.	Modify hyperparameters or experiment with different kernels to improve model performance.
